"# FirstRepo" 
This is just my "figuring out GitHub" project.
Trying to get familiar with push/pull/commit.

The only file with legitimate functionality for practical use is the O365 script for a few common O365 Exchange functions.

The prompts and the Restore-AD were both labs for classes that use external files that are not included on this GitHub.
