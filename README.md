"# FirstRepo" 
This is just my "figuring out GitHub" project
Trying to figure out how to do push and pulls etc.
Maybe I'll get the hang of it eventually?

The only file with legitimate functionality for practical use is the O365 script for a few common O365 Exchange functions.

The prompts and the Restore-AD were both labs for classes that use external files that are not included on this GitHub.
